Lemon Tree

I turn myself up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see, just another lemon tree
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see, just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see, just another lemon tree
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see, just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see, just another lemon tree
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see, just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see, just another lemon tree
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see, just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see, just another lemon tree
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see, just a yellow lemon tree

Fade Into You

I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take the breath that's true
I look to you, and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart, and you'll go black
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then smiles cover your heart
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew

Somewhere Only We Know

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So, why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So, why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Die 4 Me

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I'm gon' save her tonight
But you lied, savior, but you lied
You lied to me
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah
I hope you think about me every time you touch it
I hope your new girl hears it and she loves it
Devil's front door and I'm banging on the line
If I said I want an answer I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin', yeah
They say what the devil can't do
He's gonna send a woman to
You seek to hide, you're dead inside
Won't see me cry
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage, you can hear it in this verse, honey
Turns out it shows, 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold forty million copies of our break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
So now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets, you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy 'cause I know
Nothing's changed though
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah
This is the last time, I'ma do you the honor
I'll give you a headline, I know I shouldn't bother
This is a lesson to take, hold someone tight and they break
Then you say it's a mistake, but you meant it anyway
Now you can't blame me, tell them you made me
Ignore the shit that you did on the daily
Think that you played me, but you can't save me
All of that shit 'bout how I'm fucking crazy
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah

Live or Die

On our way to the sky
We're gonna look down on tonight
When we die, you and I
Two heartbreak soldiers
When you lay by my side
I see the whole world through your eyes
Ride or die, you and I
Live or die, yeah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight, yeah
Live or die, yeah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight
Have you ever seen a red flower? Yeah
Have you ever seen a gold flower? Aye
Came from a broken home, parents never saw it
Now I'm livin' all alone, taking care of us all, yeah
Flashes in my face, I guess that's what you get with all this fame
Just because it's that you gang does not mean that you really gang
Weather changes with my mood, it never really stays the same
And one plus one is two, and without you I think I'd go insane
And what you think? Pause, let it sink in
They threw me in and now I'm drowning in the deep end
If I'm religious, you're the one that I believe in
You've been here with me to help me fight all my demons
On our way to the sky
We're gonna look down on tonight
When we die, you and I
Two heartbreak soldiers
When you lay by my side
I see the whole world through your eyes
Ride or die, you and I
To live or die, what's the price on a life?
If there ain't no price tag, I might take it right
If I hit it from the back, I might just hit it twice
Rest in peace to everyone that we lost in life
And I just wanna run away-ay-ay
I just wanna run away-ay-ay
I just wanna run away-ay-ay, yeah-eah-eah-eah, ay
(With you, baby)
Live or die, yeahh
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight, yeah
Live or die, yeah
Live or die
Got you and I
Got you tonight

Summertime Sadness

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
